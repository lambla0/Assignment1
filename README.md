### projects.html
# - Each project is wrapped around the article tag which groups related content, h2 as the heading, and <p> for the description
# - Includes the navigation bar, same as other files, 
# - Head setup stays the same with title and link to all css files.

### full.css
# - the * {} part makes sure all elements start with no spacing and use consitent box sizing
# - the body provides the background image as for all files, fills the screen, makes sure text is white and readable. 
# - extra padding at the bottom so the text doesnt overlap the footer
# - header bar stays with haveing the trans background
# - the nav removes bullets from navigation links, places them side by side, adds spacing, and makes it bold and white
# - the main centers the project section, makes the project titles and descriiptions centered organized top to bottom
# - footer includes the contact info and stays at the bttom matching the header

# Phase 4


### contact.html
# - For the form put in a bunch of inputs like for name single line text required field, this is applied to all 
# - In put is required, used info from here: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp

### full.css
# - So I reset spacing using * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; } makes sizing consistent for all the elements
# - Made sure the body fills the screen
# - header includes background color with transperency, padding, and centered text
# - the nav system stays the same where it creates horizontal menu, remove bullets and space links, makes it white and bold
# - main centeres content with max width and top to bottom spacing
